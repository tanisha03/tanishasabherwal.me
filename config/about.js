        "I am a computer science engineer who has an eye for digital products. I love to quench my thirst for “why to build” and “how to build”. I enjoy Product-driven development along with discussing UX flows, accessibility, designs  pattern and business with anyone and everyone.",

        "I am stickler for design and colors while being passionate for front-end development. It is always fun exploring how meaningful experiences can be produced with just the right amount of hues, placement and animations.",

        "When I am away from my screen, I read books, play my favourite chords on uklele, paint and love do DIYs."
